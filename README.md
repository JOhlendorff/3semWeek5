#Week5 Review <br/>
#Problems with commiting friday and thursday. Friday and thursday have been added as zip files <br/>
#Solutions for each day is in the folders named after the day<br/>
#Thursday introduced DTO, employeeDTO is added to contain only the fields shown in the browser<br/>
#Wednesday introduced REST, which designates the paths and resources that are used to show entities in the browser<br/>
#Tuesday introduced JPA, which i use to add entities to the database through a persistence unit<br/>
#Fridays assignment implements all of these things<br/>
 </br>
 I completed all assignments except Friday, where i had problems with my persistence unit.
